        <h2>Family-Owned, Customer-Focused</h2>
        <p>Osborne Electric & Contracting is a family-owned electrical contracting business founded by brothers Trevor and Wes Osborne. As licensed electricians with years of experience, we built this company on a simple principle: <strong>treat every job like it's our own home.</strong></p>
        <p>We've seen the problems that come from rushed work, cut corners, and electricians who don't care. That's not us. When we're in your home, we take the time to do things right because your safety and satisfaction matter to us.</p>
        <p>Whether it's a simple outlet repair or a complete home rewiring, we bring the same level of care and expertise to every project we take on.</p>
